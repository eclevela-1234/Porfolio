## Final Thoughts
* First start-from-scratch assignment of the boot camp was a challenge!
* I gave myself plenty of time to fine tune but still ran up against the clock
* I am overall happy with the funtionality but design element/colochoices could use a re-work - it really never ends
* I tripped quite a few times but got back up. I am confident that it will go smoother in the future!
